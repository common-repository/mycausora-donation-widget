*How it works*
MyCausora has created a new platform that links donors, charities, and businesses. Businesses are able to be philanthropic while gaining new, like-minded customers. Causes and charities raise more money and can give donors a thank you gift. When users donate $ to a cause, they receive $ to spend with Causora thank you rewards (e.g. Donate $20, get $20 to spend). Everyone wins.
